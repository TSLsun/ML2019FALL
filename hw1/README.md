# ML2019FALL-HW1
Machine Learning (2019, Fall) HW1 - PM2.5 Prediction


## Predict testing data
1. **hw1.sh**

```
bash hw1.sh [input testing data csv] [output file]
```

2. **hw1_best.sh**

> PS: hw1_best.sh is same as hw1.sh

```
bash hw1_best.sh [input testing data csv] [output file]
```

## Training reproduce and predict

* implement adam

* generate `weight.npy`, `train_mean.npy`, `train_std.npy`, `featureMean.pickle`

```
bash train_hw1.sh [input year1-data csv] [input year2-data csv] [input testing data csv] [output file]
```
